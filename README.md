The weather dashboard enables users to search for a city's current weather and forecast for the next 5 days.
The user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
When the user views the UV index, they're presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable (blue), moderate (orange), or severe (red).
The future weather conditions for that city are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
When a city in the search history is clicked, the current and future conditions for that city are presented.
